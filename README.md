# SNSMC

SNSMC is a Social Networking System implementation. Notice this is a headless plugin. Only SNS management (via API), hologram topic view, I18N, typesafe topic search, etc. are provided. Other user features like UI, permission, command etc. is not provided directly by this program.

If you want to use this program in production. First at your own risk. Without any warranty. Then you should implement those things by yourself using API provided by this program. Or you can download already exists implementation if available.

There is a plan to develop an official UI or commands support plugin. But I have no enough time and energy to do so. If you are interested in this. Please contact me <3.

This is mainly an code skill practice project for me at now. So probably I'll implement many fancy things may not have direct relationship to main features. So don't ask me like "Why this thing not done in that way?"
